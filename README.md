## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Being in the 2nd week of learning for my Web Developer journey (only learnt about Flexbox today), I've definitely realised building a site from scratch does take a lot of thinking about, espcially at my level.

### Continued development

Only on the first day of my 2nd week of a baseline course on web development, but I do realise that this is a never ending learning journey. I'm intending to consolidate the knowledge I've learnt so far (hence I've started using this site) and am looking forward to improving my skills as I continue on this journey.
